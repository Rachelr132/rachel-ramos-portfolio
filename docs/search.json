Homer Simpson consistently has the most lines across all seasons, peaking around season 10. Bart, Marge, and Lisa have fewer lines with moderate fluctuations over time. One of the top 5 entries is labeled “NA,” likely due to missing or unlinked character data/ extras. The dialogue remains centered around Homer, with other main characters contributing steadily."

Overall, the show remains grounded in the family’s home, with other settings used more episodically."
